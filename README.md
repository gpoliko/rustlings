# Gio's rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

My (Gio's) personal run through of rustlings. The beginnings of my deep dive into the Rust programming language.

This project is a fork of the original [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project. The `solutions` branch contains my attempts to the small exercises that aim to help me to read and write Rust code.

_...looking for the old, web-based version of Rustlings? Try [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/rustlings-1)_

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online
